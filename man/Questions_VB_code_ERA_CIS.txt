 What does the Sub SetupProgressBar does? why does use refresh inside it?

 Why is Me.Refresh being used so often, even when the data has not changed?

 SQL interactions, read tables - 
is the statement from  ERASQL = "SELECT Min(age) FROM ERA_CWDBRecovery as r INNER JOIN ERA_WireTagCode as t ON r.TagCode = t.TagCode  WHERE CASStock IN (" & CASStockString & ")" the actual SQL query?

GetCASStocks -  the ERASQL statement is not working with the R connection

 isCombineAge5And6[ERAStock] loop
 The last else statement seem redundant. 


I do not understand what the following code does. 
CISDataAdapter = New OleDbDataAdapter(ERASQL, CISDBConnection)
Dim CASStockTable As New DataTable
CISDataAdapter.Fill(CASStockTable)



GetFirstAndLastBY - the ERASQL statement is not working with the R connection
